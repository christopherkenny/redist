\title{Compute Distance between Partitions}
\usage{
redist.distances(
  district_membership,
  measure = "Hamming",
  ncores = 1,
  pop = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{district_membership}{A matrix with one row for each precinct and one
column for each map. Required.}

\item{measure}{String vector indicating which distances to compute. Implemented
currently are "Hamming", "Manhattan", "Euclidean", and "variation of information",
Use "all" to return all implemented measures.  Not case sensitive, and
any unique substring is enough, e.g. "ham" for Hamming, or "info" for
variation of information.}

\item{ncores}{Number of cores to use for parallel computing. Default is 1.}

\item{pop}{The vector of precinct populations. Used only if computing
variation of information. If not provided, equal population of precincts
will be assumed, i.e. the VI will be computed with respect to the precincts
themselves, and not the population.}
}
\value{
a named list of distance matrices, one for each distance measure selected.
}
\description{
Compute Distance between Partitions
}
\details{
Hamming distance measures the number of different precinct assignments
between plans. Manhattan and Euclidean distances are the 1- and 2-norms for
the assignment vectors.  All three of the Hamming, Manhattan, and Euclidean
distances implemented here are not invariant to permutations of the district
labels; permuting will cause large changes in measured distance, and maps
which are identical up to a permutation may be computed to be maximally
distant.

Variation of Information is a metric on population partitions (i.e.,
districtings) which is invariant to permutations of the district labels, and
arises out of information theory. It is calculated as \deqn{
    VI(\xi, \xi') = -\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n pop(\xi_i \cap \xi'_j)/P
    (2log(pop(\xi_i \cap \xi'_j)) - log(pop(\xi_i)) - log(pop(\xi'_j)))
} where \eqn{\xi,\xi'} are the partitions, \eqn{\xi_i,\xi_j} the individual
districts, \eqn{pop(\cdot)} is the population, and \eqn{P} the total
population of the state. VI is also expressible as the difference between
the joint entropy and the mutual information (see references).
