\arguments{
\item{adjobj}{An adjacency matrix, list, or object of class
"SpatialPolygonsDataFrame."}

\item{popvec}{A vector containing the populations of each geographic unit.}

\item{nsims}{The number of samples to draw.}

\item{ndists}{The number of districts in each redistricting plan.}

\item{counties}{A vector containing county (or other administrative or
geographic unit) labels for each unit, which must  be integers ranging from 1
to the number of counties.  If provided, the algorithm will only generate
maps which split up to \code{ndists-1} counties.  If no county-split
constraint is desired, this parameter should be left blank.}

\item{popcons}{The desired population constraint.  All sampled districts
will have a deviation from the target district size no more than this value
in percentage terms, i.e., \code{popcons=0.01} will ensure districts have
populations within 1\% of the target population.}

\item{compactness}{Controls the compactness of the generated districts, with
higher values preferring more compact districts. Must be nonnegative. See the
'Details' section for more information, and computational considerations.}

\item{constraints}{A list containing information on constraints to implement.
See the 'Details' section for more information.}

\item{resample}{Whether to perform a final resampling step so that the
generated plans can be used immediately.  Set this to \code{FALSE} to perform
direct importance sampling estimates, or to adjust the weights manually.}

\item{constraint_fn}{A function which takes in a matrix where each column is
a redistricting plan and outputs a vector of log-weights, which will be
added the the final weights.}

\item{adapt_k_thresh}{The threshold value used in the heuristic to select a
value \code{k_i} for each splitting iteration. Set to 0.9999 or 1 if
the algorithm does not appear to be sampling from the target distribution.
Must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{seq_alpha}{The amount to adjust the weights by at each resampling step;
higher values prefer exploitation, while lower values prefer exploration.
Must be between 0 and 1.}

\item{truncate}{Whether to truncate the importance sampling weights at the
final step by \code{trunc_fn}.  Recommended if \code{compactness} is not 1.}

\item{trunc_fn}{A function which takes in a vector of weights and returns
a truncated vector. Recommended to specify this manually if truncating weights.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print out intermediate information while sampling.
Recommended.}

\item{silent}{Whether to supress all diagnostic information.}
}
\value{
\code{redist.smc} returns an object of class \code{redist}, which
is a list containing the following components:
\item{aList}{The adjacency list used to sample}
\item{cdvec}{The matrix of sampled plans. Each row is a geographical unit,
and each column is a sample.}
\item{wgt}{The importance sampling weights, normalized to sum to 1.}
\item{orig_wgt}{The importance sampling weights before resampling or truncation, normalized to have mean 1.}
\item{nsims}{The number of plans sampled.}
\item{pct_dist_parity}{The population constraint.}
\item{compactness}{The compactness constraint.}
\item{counties}{The computed constraint options list (see above).}
\item{maxdev}{The maximum population deviation of each sample.}
\item{popvec}{The provided vector of unit populations.}
\item{counties}{The provided county vector.}
\item{adapt_k_thresh}{The provided control parameter.}

\description{
\code{redist.smc} uses a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to
generate nearly independent congressional or legislative redistricting
plans according to contiguity, population, compactness, and administrative
boundary constraints.
}
\details{
This function draws nearly-independent samples from a specific target measure,
controlled by the \code{popcons}, \code{compactness}, \code{constraints}, and
\code{constraint_fn} parameters.

Higher values of \code{compactness} sample more compact districts;
setting this parameter to 1 is computationally efficient and generates nicely
compact districts.  Values of other than 1 may lead to highly variable
importance sampling weights.  By default these weights are truncated at
\code{nsims^0.04 / 100} to stabilize the resulting estimates, but if truncation
is used, a specific truncation function should probably be chosen by the user.

The \code{constraints} parameter allows the user to apply several common
redistricting contraints without implementing them by hand. This parameter
is a list, which may contain any of the following named entries:
\itemize{
\item \code{status_quo}: a list with two entries:
\itemize{
\item \code{strength}, a number controlling the tendency of the generated districts
to respect the status quo, with higher values preferring more similar
districts.
\item \code{current}, a vector containing district assignments for
the current map.
}
\item \code{vra}: a list with five entries:
\itemize{
\item \code{strength}, a number controlling the strength of the Voting Rights Act
(VRA) constraint, with higher values prioritizing majority-minority districts
over other considerations.
\item \code{tgt_vra_min}, the target percentage of minority voters in minority
copportunity districts. Defaults to 0.55.
\item \code{tgt_vra_other} The target percentage of minority voters in other
districts. Defaults to 0.25, but should be set to reflect the total minority
population in the state.
\item \code{pow_vra}, which controls the allowed deviation from the target
minority percentage; higher values are more tolerant. Defaults to 1.5
\item \code{min_pop}, A vector containing the minority population of each
geographic unit.
}
\item \code{incumbency}: a list with two entries:
\itemize{
\item \code{strength}, a number controlling the tendency of the generated districts
to avoid pairing up incumbents.
\item \code{incumbents}, a vector of precinct indices, one for each incumbent's
home address.
}
