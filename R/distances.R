#' Compute Distance between Partitions
#'
#' @param district_membership A matrix with one row for each precinct and one
#' column for each map. Required.
#' @param measure String vector indicating which distances to compute. Implemented
#' currently are "Hamming", "Manhattan", "Euclidean", and "variation of information",
#' Use "all" to return all implemented measures.  Not case sensitive, and
#' any unique substring is enough, e.g. "ham" for Hamming, or "info" for
#' variation of information.
#' @param ncores Number of cores to use for parallel computing. Default is 1.
#' @param pop The vector of precinct populations. Used only if computing
#'   variation of information. If not provided, equal population of precincts
#'   will be assumed, i.e. the VI will be computed with respect to the precincts
#'   themselves, and not the population.
#'
#' @details
#' Hamming distance measures the number of different precinct assignments
#' between plans. Manhattan and Euclidean distances are the 1- and 2-norms for
#' the assignment vectors.  All three of the Hamming, Manhattan, and Euclidean
#' distances implemented here are not invariant to permutations of the district
#' labels; permuting will cause large changes in measured distance, and maps
#' which are identical up to a permutation may be computed to be maximally
#' distant.
#'
#' Variation of Information is a metric on population partitions (i.e.,
#' districtings) which is invariant to permutations of the district labels, and
#' arises out of information theory. It is calculated as \deqn{
#'     VI(\xi, \xi') = -\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{j=1}^n pop(\xi_i \cap \xi'_j)/P
#'     (2log(pop(\xi_i \cap \xi'_j)) - log(pop(\xi_i)) - log(pop(\xi'_j)))
#' } where \eqn{\xi,\xi'} are the partitions, \eqn{\xi_i,\xi_j} the individual
#' districts, \eqn{pop(\cdot)} is the population, and \eqn{P} the total
#' population of the state. VI is also expressible as the difference between
#' the joint entropy and the mutual information (see references).
#'
#' @return a named list of distance matrices, one for each distance measure selected.
